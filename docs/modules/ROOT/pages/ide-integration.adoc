Use the generated schema to validate and autocomplete configuration files.

== IntelliJ IDEA / JetBrains IDEs
Add a $schema reference at the top of your YAML:
[source,yaml]
----
$schema: "https://alexmond.github.io/spring-boot-config-json-schema-starter/current/_attachments/boot-generic-config.json"

spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:h2:mem:testdb
----

Notes:
- $schema must appear before content.
- You can also reference a locally served schema (for example, a REST endpoint).

== Visual Studio Code
Use the YAML language server directive at the very top:
[source,yaml]
----
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://alexmond.github.io/spring-boot-config-json-schema-starter/current/_attachments/boot-generic-config.yaml

spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:h2:mem:testdb
----

Notes:
- The directive must be the first line (as a comment).
- You can switch to a locally served schema when running the app.
