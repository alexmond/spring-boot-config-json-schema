= Troubleshooting

Common issues and quick fixes.

== Missing properties in schema
- Ensure the Spring Boot configuration processor is on the classpath.
- Verify classes are annotated with @ConfigurationProperties.

== Enum casing or values differ
- Check actual enum constants; schema reflects source values.
- Confirm metadata and compiled classes are up to date (clean build).

== IDE does not validate
- Confirm $schema line (JetBrains) or YAML directive (VS Code) is at the top.
- Ensure the schema URL is reachable or the local endpoint is running.
- Reload the editor window if caching interferes.

== REST/Actuator endpoint returns empty/404
- Verify controller/endpoint is loaded (component scan).
- Check endpoint paths and exposure settings if using management endpoints.

== CI step flaky
- Pin schema generation to a specific build phase.
- Cache dependencies but not build outputs that affect metadata unless consistent.
