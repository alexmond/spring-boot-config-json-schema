Validate configuration in pipelines using the generated schema.

== Typical approaches
- Generate schema during build (test scope) and publish as artifact.
- Validate environment-specific YAML/Properties against the schema.

== Pipeline outline
1. Build the project and generate schema files (JSON/YAML).
2. Make schema available to validation step (workspace or artifact).
3. Run a schema validation task for each configuration file.

== Tips
- Keep schema generation deterministic by ensuring configuration metadata is up to date.
- Fail the pipeline on validation errors to catch misconfig early.
